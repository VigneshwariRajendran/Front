  <p>
    Happy Paws is a unique pet care service that offers full service pet care for pet owners that demand loving care for their pets and who need to feel complete confidence their pets can be left in a safe and loving environment. Regardless of whether it’s short term day care during the work week, or longer term in-home or boarding care while you vacation, Happy Paws Pet Care can guarantee a safe, secure and caring environment for your pet.
While most professional pet boarding services offer excellent facilities, the fact is your pets are removed from their safe and familiar living environments with little or no human contact which they thrive on. They often spend more time confined in cages in an environment that’s completely alien to the loving, secure atmosphere of a home, where consistent human contact and attention ensures their well-being and security.</br>
  </br>
Happy Paws Pet Care Services offers total boarding services in a cage-free, home environment with a large, fenced-in yard, daily walks, meals and treats that conform to your pet’s at-home schedules, with the added benefit of consistent human attention and loving care that your pet has become used to in your own home environment. Or, if you prefer, Happy Paws also offers full pet care services in your home while you work or vacation, including overnight pet care services in your home in order to give your pet the security of remaining in its secure and familiar home setting and giving your pet the familiar and secure feeling of loving human contact.
Happy Paws Pet services has been in business for over two years and its owners, Tracey Ziegler and Tom Hasz, are long time pet professionals with experience in agricultural husbandry, training in grooming and nail trimming, dog walking, pet boarding and are life-long dog and cat owners. They have raised birds, bunnies, cats and dogs and have earned a well-deserved reputation as sensitive and caring animal lovers by their clients. No matter what your requirements—dog walking or daily meal or pet check-in services, short term or long term uncaged pet care on-site or short or longer term pet care in your home, T&T Pet Services can offer you affordable, safe, secure and loving services for your pet.
